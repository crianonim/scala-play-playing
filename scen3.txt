You are an underwater explorer. You are leaving to explore the deepest oceans. You must find
the lost city of Atlantis. This is your most challenging assignment.
It is morning and the sun pushes up on the
horizon. The sea is calm. You climb into the narrow pilot's compartment of the underwater vessel
Seeker with your special gear. The crew of the
research vessel Maray screws down the hatch
clamps. Now begins the plunge into the depths of
the ocean. The Seeker crew begins lowering by a
strong, but thin cable. Within minutes, you are so
deep in the ocean that little light filters down to
you. The silence is eerie as the Seeker slips deeper
and deeper. You peer out the thick glass porthole
and see fish drifting past, sometimes stopping to
look at you—an intruder from another world.
Now the cable attaching you to Maray is extended almost to its limit. You have come to rest on
a ledge near the canyon in the ocean floor that
supposedly leads to the lost city of Atlantis.
You have a special sea suit that will protect you
from the intense pressure of the deep if you choose
to walk about on the sea bottom. You can cut
loose from the cable if you wish because the
Seeker is self-propelled. You are now in another
world.
- explore the ledge where the Seeker has come to rest [] -> #p6
- cut loose from the Maray and dive with the Seeker into the canyon in the ocean floor [] -> #p5

#p5
You radio a status report to the Moray and tell
them that you are going to cast off from the line
and descend under your own power. Your plan is
approved and you cast off your line. Now you are
on your own. The Seeker slips noiselessly into the
undersea canyon.
As you drop into the canyon, you turn on the
Seeker's powerful searchlight. Straight ahead is a
dark wall covered with a strange type of barnacle
growth. To the left (port) side you see what ap-
pears to be a grotto. The entrance is perfectly
round, as if it had been cut by human hands.
Lantern fish give off a pale, greenish light. To the
right (starboard) side of the Seeker you see bub-
bles rising steadily from the floor of the canyon.
- investigate the bubbles [] -> #p8
- investigate the grotto with the round entrance [] -> #p9

#p6
Your sea suit will protect you from the intense
pressures of the deep. It is a tight fit and takes you
some time to put it on. Finally you slip from the
airlock of the Seeker and stand on the ocean floor.
It is a strange and marvelous world where your
every move is slowed down. You begin to explore
with your special hand-held searchlight. You
examine the ledge by the canyon.
Suddenly, a school of bright yellow angel fish
dart by, almost brushing you. What made them
move so fast? Are they being chased?
Then you see it. The Seeker is in the grips of a
huge sea monster. It is similar to a squid, but it is
enormous. The Seeker is just a toy in its long,
powerful tentacles. You seek shelter behind a rock
formation. You know the spear gun you carry will
be useless against this monster. It looks as though it
will destroy the Seeker. Fish of all sizes huddle with
you in an attempt to escape the monster.
- stay hidden close to the Seeker [] -> #p10
- try to escape in the hope that rescuers will see you [] -> #p12

#p8
Carefully, you maneuver the Seeker between
the walls of the canyon.
On the floor of the canyon, you discover a large
round hole out of which flow the large bubbles.
The Seeker is equipped with scientific equipment
to analyze the bubbles. It also has sonar equip-
ment that can measure the depth of any hole.
- analyze the bubbles [] -> #p11
- take sonar readings [] -> #p15

#p9
You pilot the Seeker through the rounded en-
trance to the grotto. Once inside, your searchlight
picks up what appear to be docks and piers along
the grotto walls. The Seeker's searchlight is not
very powerful. However, you do have a special
laser light which would light up the grotto like
daylight. Unfortunately, the laser light can only be
used twice for very short periods before it must be
recharged aboard the Maray, now more than
2,000 feet above you on the surface.
- use the laser light [] -> #p16
- cruise further into the grotto [] -> #p14

#p10
The giant squid tosses and turns the Seeker, but
finally the creature grows tired of its new game and
jets off with an enormous squirt of water. You now
are free to leave your hiding place and examine
the Seeker for damage.
To your dismay, the airlock entrance has been
jammed shut. You are locked out of the Seeker.
The crew of the Maray, however, suspected trou-
ble when you did not respond to a routine radio
check and they are now lowering an escape plat-
form to you. Once on the platform, you radio them
to start the slow pull to the surface. To avoid the
bends—rapid expansion of nitrogen bubbles in
your blood—they will have to bring you up very
slowly.
Just as the platform begins to move, the giant
squid suddenly returns as if from nowhere. It is
headed directly at you.
- fight the squid with your spear gun, hoping to scare it off [] -> #p17
- signal Maray to pull you up at top speed, knowing you will get the bends [] -> #p18

#p11
You squeeze into your sea suit and, outside the
Seeker, you use special equipment to analyze the
bubbles. As you work, you clumsily knock against
the valve that dumps the compressed air necessary
to make the Seeker rise to the surface. There is
nothing to be done about it; so you continue to
analyze the bubbles. They contain a high percent-
age of oxygen and no poisonous gases. Perhaps
they are coming from some area below the sea
where human-type beings can live and breathe.
Perhaps they are coming from Atlantis.
You wonder whether you should try the
Seeker's drilling arm to enlarge the source of the
bubbles so you can explore it with the Seeker. But
you are also very worried about the Seeker's loss
of rising capability. You might also be able to trap
the bubbles and use them to raise the Seeker.
- collect the bubbles coming from the hole to fill the tanks of the Seeker [] -> #p24
- drill [] -> #p22

#p12
Moving cautiously, you climb up the sides of the
canyon hoping to reach the ocean floor. You leave
the Seeker in the grips of the giant squid. Your plan
is to signal for help with a dye marker that will float
to the surface and make a bright yellow patch in
the water. The crewmen above have been in-
structed to watch for such emergency signals.
They will send help.
Once you reach the ledge above the canyon
and feel slightiy safer, you see the most feared of all
sea creatures— a huge shark. It begins to circle
towards you and you know that you are its target.
You wonder whether you should fire your
emergency propulsion charge that will send you
rapidly to the surface. The shark is fast; he might
catch you anyway. You also know that you will get
the bends from the rapid rise to the surface.
- fire the special propulsion charge to get to the surface [] -> #p21
- wait quietly hoping that the shark will go away [] -> #p19

#p14
You cruise silently into the grotto. Its roof seems
to slope upward and you follow the slope. The
depth finder shows that you are rising quite
rapidly. Perhaps you will reach the surface and
open air. Then the roof of the grotto stops sloping
upward. Before you is a perfectly round metallic
hatch made of a metal that you have never seen
before. With the mechanical arm of the Seeker
you try to open the hatch. It will not open. You
begin to send radio signals at the door hoping to
make contact on the other side.
- blow the hatch open with an explosive charge [] -> #p26
- continue transmitting radio communications through the hatch [] -> #p28

#p15
You maneuver the Seeker next to the hole and
begin to take sonar readings to determine the
depth of the hole. To your amazement, the sonar
readings indicate that the hole is extraordinarily
deep— it might reach the center of the earth!
What lies down there? Where are the bubbles
coming from? Is Atlantis beneath you?
Then you notice a disturbing reading on your
instruments; a mild earthquake has occurred. The
Seeker is not damaged, but the earthquake could
set up a tsunami wave on the surface causing the
Moray to leave for safer areas. It might be danger-
ous not to get back to the surface and leave with
the Moray. On the other hand, you are perhaps on
the verge of one of the world's greatest dis-
coveries.
- descend into the hole [] -> #p23
- return to the surface [] -> #p27

#p16
The beam from the laser light illuminates the
entire grotto. Far back on the floor of the grotto is a
submarine! Cautiously, you maneuver the Seeker
closer. You identify it as the submarine that myste-
riously disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle al-
most a year before. The Bermuda Triangle is more
than 2000 miles away.
The submarine is apparently not damaged, but
it is covered with a slimy algae. Beautiful fish swim
around it as though it is their own special prize.
Then you notice that the main hatch is free of
algae!
- try to enter the submarine [] -> #p29
- ruise on through the grotto [] -> #p31

#p17
With a rush of water, the giant squid attacks you.
Two 20 foot tentacles with their pulsing suction
cups reach out trying to ensnare you. You dive off
the platform and rapidly fire two of your spears.
They strike the squid close to its two monstrous
eyes. But the squid keeps on coming.
One of the tentacles wraps around your diving
helmet and ruptures the seal to your suit. You fire
your last spear hoping to hit the monster in a
vulnerable spot. Water is beginning to trickle into
your suit. You signal the Maray to haul you up
fast— "Emergency Hoist." You must have hit the
squid. It floats away writhing and thrashing. You
think you're about to black out.
You wake up on the deck of the Moray and are
quickly rushed to the decompression chambers to
ward off the effect of the bends. In a few days you
are better and start to worry about diving into the
abyss again.
- quit the expedition now [] -> #p32
- go back down to the deep [] -> #p33

#p18
As they begin the rapid hauling, you lose your
ability to function in the deep. You start to get dizzy
and your arms and legs feel weak. You lose your
hold on the platform and drift in the water
exhausted. Then you see a dolphin heading to-
ward you. You know that these marvelous
mammals sometimes help people in trouble. Will it
help you?
- get help from the dolphin [] -> #p34
- carry on alone swimming to the surface [] -> #p37

#p19
You wait for the shark to go away. But then you
notice other sharks coming to join in the hunt.
They circle you, coming closer and faster each
time. It is too late. There is no escape!
The End
- start again [] -> #p1
